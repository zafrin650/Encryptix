# Encryptix: Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains the three projects completed as part of the internship program at Encryptix.

## Project 1: Movie Genre Classification

### Objective
Predict the genres of different movies based on their plot summary.

### Steps Involved
1. **Importing Important Libraries and Loading the Dataset:**
   - Import numpy,scipy,sci-kit learn and various other libraries
   - Loading the train and test dataset

2. **Data Visualization:**
   -
   - Visualizations using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps
     
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   -  Data cleaning is done by using regular expressions 
   - Addressed data imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques
   
3. **Model Building:**
   - Tested models: Naive Bayes 
   - Used cross-validation for robustness

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
   - Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search

5. **Result Interpretation:**
   - Final model predictions and feature importance analysis

## Project 2: Credit card fraud detection

### Objective
Predict future sales of a company using historical sales data.

### Steps Involved
### Objective
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Used a dataset of credit card transactions
   - Addressed data imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques

2. **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
   - Applied oversampling 

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Converted the categorical data columns into numerical data columns accordingly

4. **Model Building:**
